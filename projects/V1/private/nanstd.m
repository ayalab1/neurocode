function y = nanstd(varargin)
%NANSTD Standard deviation, ignoring NaNs.
%   Y = NANSTD(X) returns the sample standard deviation of the values in X,
%   treating NaNs as missing values.  For a vector input, Y is the standard
%   deviation of the non-NaN elements of X.  For a matrix input, Y is a row
%   vector containing the standard deviation of the non-NaN elements in
%   each column of X. For N-D arrays, NANSTD operates along the first
%   non-singleton dimension of X.
%
%   NANSTD normalizes Y by (N-1), where N is the sample size.  This is the
%   square root of an unbiased estimator of the variance of the population
%   from which X is drawn, as long as X consists of independent, identically
%   distributed samples and data are missing at random.
%
%   Y = NANSTD(X,1) normalizes by N and produces the square root of the
%   second moment of the sample about its mean.  NANSTD(X,0) is the same as
%   NANSTD(X).
%
%   Y = NANSTD(X,FLAG,DIM) takes the standard deviation along dimension
%   DIM of X.

%NANVAR Variance, ignoring NaNs.
%   Y = NANVAR(X) returns the sample variance of the values in X, treating
%   NaNs as missing values.  For a vector input, Y is the variance of the
%   non-NaN elements of X.  For a matrix input, Y is a row vector
%   containing the variance of the non-NaN elements in each column of X.
%   For N-D arrays, NANVAR operates along the first non-singleton dimension
%   of X.
%
%   NANVAR normalizes Y by N-1 if N>1, where N is the sample size of the 
%   non-NaN elements.  This is an unbiased estimator of the variance of the
%   population from which X is drawn, as long as X consists of independent,
%   identically distributed samples, and data are missing at random.  For
%   N=1, Y is normalized by N. 
%
%   Y = NANVAR(X,1) normalizes by N and produces the second moment of the
%   sample about its mean.  NANVAR(X,0) is the same as NANVAR(X).
%
%   Y = NANVAR(X,W) computes the variance using the weight vector W.  The
%   length of W must equal the length of the dimension over which NANVAR
%   operates, and its non-NaN elements must be nonnegative.  Elements of X
%   corresponding to NaN elements of W are ignored.
%
%   Y = NANVAR(X,W,DIM) takes the variance along dimension DIM of X.
