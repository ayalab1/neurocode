function residuals = CorrResiduals(spikes, intervals1, intervals2)

% Computes the residuals of the post vs pre pairwise spike train correlations
% using the intervals provided, as described by Giri2019 JNeurosci
% Pearson's correlation for each pair of neuron's spikes will be computed 
% within intervals1 (e.g. rippes in pre-task sleep) as well as intervals2
% (e.g. ripples in post-task sleep). For each interval, the spikes emitted by each
% unit are counted, and if units M and N fire in a correlated manner within the
% provided windows, corr(M,N) would be high.
