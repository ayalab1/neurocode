function out = notch_filter(in, fSample, fNotch, Bandwidth)

% out = notch_filter(in, fSample, fNotch, Bandwidth)
%
% Implements a notch filter (e.g., for 50 or 60 Hz) on vector 'in'.
% fSample = sample rate of data (in Hz or Samples/sec)
% fNotch = filter notch frequency (in Hz)
% Bandwidth = notch 3-dB bandwidth (in Hz).  A bandwidth of 10 Hz is
%   recommended for 50 or 60 Hz notch filters; narrower bandwidths lead to
%   poor time-domain properties with an extended ringing response to
%   transient disturbances.
%
% Example:  If neural data was sampled at 30 kSamples/sec
% and you wish to implement a 60 Hz notch filter:
%
% out = notch_filter(in, 30000, 60, 10);

tstep = 1/fSample;
Fc = fNotch*tstep;

L = length(in);

% Calculate IIR filter parameters
d = exp(-2*pi*(Bandwidth/2)*tstep);
b = (1 + d*d)*cos(2*pi*Fc);
a0 = 1;
a1 = -b;
a2 = d*d;
a = (1 + d*d)/2;
b0 = 1;
b1 = -2*cos(2*pi*Fc);
b2 = 1;

out = zeros(size(in));
out(1) = in(1);  
out(2) = in(2);
% (If filtering a continuous data stream, change out(1) and out(2) to the
%  previous final two values of out.)

% Run filter
for i=3:L
    out(i) = (a*b2*in(i-2) + a*b1*in(i-1) + a*b0*in(i) - a2*out(i-2) - a1*out(i-1))/a0;
end
