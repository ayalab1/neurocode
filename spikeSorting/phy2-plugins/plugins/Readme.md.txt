Updated Version of some plugins for Phy2, originally created by Peter Petersen, plus one visualization for spikes 
violating the refractory period and a filter for the raw traces.

To 'install', copy 'tempdir.py' in "*YourPhyDirectory*/phy/utils", copy 'phy_config.py' into
"Users/*YourUserName*/.phy" and the remaining files into "Users/*YourUserName*/.phy/plugins". 
So far only tested once on a Windows machine.
