function logical = IntervalsIntersect(intervals1, intervals2)

% This function returns a logical vector the size of intervals1, with ones 
% if any portion of intervals2 is present in the respective interval1.
% 
% This can be useful if, for example, you want to have the identity of
% the windows intervals1 which contain ripples (intervals2), without
% limiting this to the windows containing the ripple peak, but any part 
% of the ripple.
