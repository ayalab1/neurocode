function [start, stop, dur, peak, numCat] = CatCon(evtstart,evtstop,evtpeak,evtamp,flagConc)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CatCon-Concatenation with Condition function
% This function is to be used in conjunction with the find_HSE_b code. For
% proper use, it will intake event start, stop, and peak times, as well as
% the amplitude of each peak and a logical array designating what must be
% concatenated. This must be calculated outside of the function. The fields 
% that aren't needed can be bypassed by inputting arrays of zeros/ones.
%
%%% INPUTS %%%
% evtstart:     Array with the start times of the events of interest
% evtstop:      Array with the stop times of the events of interest
% evtpeak:      Array with the peak times of the events of interest
% evtamp:       Array with the amplitudes of the peak for each event
% flagConc:     Logical array denoting whether values should be
%               concatenated. Note that it must be arranged so that [1 0]
%               designates that event 1 and 2 should be concatenated, but 2
%               and 3 should not. flagConc will have a length of
%               length(evtstart)-1.
%
%%% OUTPUTS %%%
% start:        An updated array of start times of the events after
%               concatenation
% stop:         An updated array of stop times of the events after
%               concatenation
% dur:          An updated array of event durations after concatenation
% peak:         An updated array of peak times of the events after
%               concatenation
% numCat:       Array containing the number of events concatenated within
%               each new event. Useful for tracking burst length if
%               concatenating ISIs.
