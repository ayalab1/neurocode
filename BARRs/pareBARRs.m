%% Refine BARR detection
%
% This script pares back BARR detections based on restrictions provided as
% inputs. 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% INPUTS %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
%% REQUIRED %%
% basepath:     Location of HSE structure.
% HSE:          BARR structure created by find_HSE_BARR.m
% spikes:       Spikes structure for BARR identified pyramidal cells.
% savePath:     Prefix for HSE file to be saved, ie. [basepath
%               '\Barrage_Files\' basename '.'].
% numCell:      Number of BARR units which must participate in a BARR in
%               order for it to be kept. For most sessions, 2-3 works.
% numSpk:       Number of spikes per BARR unit needed in order to be
%               considered a participant in a particular BARR. For most
%               sessions, 4-7 spikes works best.
% pareDur:      Minimum duration of BARRs kept, in seconds. This should
%               generally be kept at or below 0.2.
% singleHz:     Firing rate needed for a single BARR unit to be allowed to
%               drive a BARR. Note that this does not mean it's the only 
%               cell firing, just that it's the only flagged cell firing.
%% OPTIONAL %%
% stim:         Logical option to indicate whether or not the session
%               includes stimulation (ie ripple generation). If so, 
%               barrages overlapping with SWRs will be removed. Default:
%               false   
% maxCell:      Maximum number of flagged units which are allowed to
%               participate in a BARR for it to be kept. This may help
%               prevent misdetection of SWRs. When set to 0, it is ignored.
%               Default: 0

%%% OUTPUTS %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% HSE:              BARR structure including...
%   timestamps:     Nx2 timestamps (s) for ALL detections before refinement
%   peaks:          Nx1 peaks (s) for ALL detections before refinement
%   amplitudes:     1xN amplitudes for ALL detections before refinement
%   amplitudeUnits: Unit in which "amplitudes" is stored
%   duration:       1xN duration (s) for ALL detections before refinement
%   center:         1xN center timestamp (s) for ALL detections before
%                   refinement
%   detectorinfo:   Variables used for detection
%   keep:           Mx1 IDXs of refined BARRs, regardless of sleepState. 
%   NREM:           Px1 IDXs of refined BARRs only in NREM sleep
%   nonRip:         Qx1 IDXs of refined BARRs, excluding BARRs overlapping
%                   with SWRs
%   fin:            Qx1 final IDXs related to HSE.timestamps (including
%                   nonRip, which is not always optimal). 
% 
%%% NOTE: 
%   BARR timestamps should generally be indexed as:
%        HSE.timestamps(HSE.keep(HSE.NREM),:)
