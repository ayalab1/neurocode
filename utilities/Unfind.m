function Logical = Unfind(indices, n)
 
%Unfind - the inverse operation of 'find': x = find(y); y = Unfind(x);
%
% When you have a logical vector, 'find' is useful as it gives you the
% indices of the non-zero values.
% This function performs the opposite operation, giving you a logical
% vector with ones in the positions of the indices provided.
%
% If you want the length of the resulting logical to be different from the
% last index provided, provide n (default = last index).
