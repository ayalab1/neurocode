% / cleanup. On realistic data (i.e. not this simulation) there will be drift also, which will usually
% mean there are merges left to do even after this step. 
% Kilosort's AUTO merges should not be confused with the "best" merges done inside the
% benchmark (those are using the real ground truth!!!)
