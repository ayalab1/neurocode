function varargout=hist2d(x,y,varargin)
%hist2d - Bivariable histogram plot
%	HIST2D(X,Y) creates a bivariate histogram plot of vectors X and Y.
%
%	The function uses an automatic binning algorithm that returns bins with
%	a uniform area, chosen to cover the range of elements in X and Y and
%	reveal the underlying shape of the distribution. HIST2D without output
%	argument displays the bins as 3-D rectangular bars such that the height
%	of each bar indicates the number of elements in the bin.
%
%	HIST2D(X,Y,NBINS) specifies the number of bins to use in each dimension
%	of the histogram (default is 10).
%
%	HIST2D(X,Y,Xedges,Yedges) specifies the edges of the bins in each
%	dimension using the vectors Xedges and Yedges.
%
%	HIST2D(...,'tile') plots the result as a tiled 2-D image.
%
%	HIST2D(...,'bar3') plots the result as a 3-D bars. This is the default
%	graph output but without this option, it will automatically switch to
%	2-D if the number of total bins exceeds 2500 (e.g. 50x50).
%
%	N = HIST2D(...) returns the bin counts matrix N of size MxP where M is
%	number of bins for Y and P the number of bins for X. No graph produced.
%	Add 'bar3' or 'tile' option to force the graph.
%
%	[N,Xbins,Ybins] = HIST2D(...) returns also the two bins vectors.
%
%	It is also possible to normalize the bin counts matrix:
%
%	HIST2D(...,'probability') normalizes bin counts as a probability. The
%	height of each bar is the relative number of observations (number of
%	observations in bin / total number of observations). The sum of the bar
%	heights is 1.
%
%	HIST2D(...,'countdensity') normalizes bin counts as count density. The
%	height of each bar is (number of observations in bin) / (area of bin).
%	The volume (height * area) of each bar is the number of observations
%	in the bin. The sum of the bar volumes is equal to numel(X) and numel(Y).
%
%	HIST2D(...,'pdf') normalizes bin counts as probability density function.
%	The height of each bar is (number of observations in the bin) / (total
%	number of observations * area of bin). The volume of each bar is the
%	relative number of observations. The sum of the bar volumes is 1.
%
%	HIST2D(...,'cumcount') normalizes bin counts as cumulative counts. The
%	height of each bar is the cumulative number of observations in each bin
%	and all previous bins in both the X and Y dimensions. The height of the
%	last bar is equal to numel(X) and numel(Y).
%
%	HIST2D(...,'cdf') normalizes bin counts as cumulative density function.
%	The height of each bar is equal to the cumulative relative number of
%	observations in each bin and all previous bins in both the X and Y
%	dimensions. The height of the last bar is 1.

%	Example:
%		x = randn(1000,1);
%		y = randn(1000,1);
%		hist2d(x,y)
