function [r,p] = CofiringCoefficient(spikes,intervals1,intervals2)

%CofiringCoefficient - Compute the cofiring coefficient between two sets of intervals.
%
% Compute the cofiring coefficient of unit pairs between two sets of intervals
% (such as theta cycles and ripples). First, count the spikes emitted by each
% unit in each interval of the first set. Compute Pearson's correlation between
% the spike counts for each cell pair, and store the results in a vector. Then
% repeat this for the second set of intervals. The cofiring coefficient is
% defined as Pearson's correlation between the two resulting vectors. Thus,
% a high value indicates that cell pair correlations are similar between the two
% sets of intervals.

%
%  INPUT
%
%    spikes         two-column matrix of timestamps and unit IDs,
%                   provided by <a href="matlab:help GetSpikeTimes">GetSpikeTimes</a> using 'output' = 'numbered'
%    intervals1     two-column matrix of start and end times
%    intervals2     two-column matrix of start and end times
%
%  OUTPUT
%
%    r              Pearson's r between the neuronal pair correlations in
%                   intervals1 and in  intervals2 (cofiring coefficient).
