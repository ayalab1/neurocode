function W = AngularVelocity(X,smooth)

%AngularVelocity - Compute instantaneous angular velocity.
%
% Compute angular velocity for a time-varying vector X. This is computed as
% the vector product of X and its derivative DX: W(t) = X(t) ^ DX(t)
%
%  USAGE
%
%    omega = AngularVelocity(X,smooth)
%
%    X              position: [t x y]
%    smooth         optional standard deviation for Gaussian kernel used for
%                   differentiating, measured in number of samples
%                   (default = no smoothing)
%
%  NOTE
%
%    Angular velocities are returned in radians/s.
