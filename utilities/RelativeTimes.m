function [rt,intervalID] = RelativeTimes(t,intervals,values)

%Relative times - compute the relative times of samples within intervals
% For example, a sample with a timestamp in the middle of an interval
% would have relative time 0.5. A sample that falls outside of the provided
% intervals would return as NaN. Multiple-column intervals are supported.
%
%   USAGE
%
%    [r,w] = RelativeTimes(t,intervals,values)
%
%    t              timestamps that will be converted in relative time
%    intervals      the [start stop] timestamps of the intervals that will
%                   serve as basis for computing the relative time. Multiple
%                   columns are allowed (for example [start peak stop] 
%                   timestamps)
%    values         the values assigned to each column in intervals
%                   (default = 0:size(intervals,2)-1), so values coinciding
%                   with intervals(:,1) would have a value of 0 and values
%                   coinciding with intervals(:,end) would have a value of
%                   size(intervals,2)-1.
%
%   OUTPUT
%
%     rt            relative times (one for each value of t)
%     intervalID    for each value of t, the row of 'intervals' in which
%                   it was detected
%
%   EXAMPLE
%
% if we have a spindle power signal [t spindlePower], then:
% rt = RelativeTimes(t, spindles(:,[1 2 3]),0:2)
% b = ceil(rt*20); % bins
% m = Accumulate(b(~isnan(b)),spindlePower(~isnan(b)),'mode','mean');
% plot(linspace(-1,1,3),m); 
% will plot the average spindle power in relative spindle time, with the
% first half covering the power between the spindle start to the spindle
% peak, and the second half covering the power between the spindle peak to
% the spindle end.

% but also 0.1 seconds before a spindle start, the 0.2 value will be ignored).
