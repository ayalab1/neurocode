function basename = basenameFromBasepath(basepath)
% gets basename from a basepath input to a function.  Uses name of the last
% directory on the path to give basename.  Takes care of the problem of the
% fact that if a fileseparator is on the end of the basepath, you have to
% take it off first.
%
